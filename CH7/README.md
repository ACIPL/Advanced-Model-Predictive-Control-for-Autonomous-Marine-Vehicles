# Simulation code for whl3, distribtued robust model predictive platooning control for ASVs
# Authors: Henglai Wei; Yang Shi.
# function: generate the robust control input for multi-ASV system to realize the platoon
# Logic: of the code is given as follows:
         The lower level solver(ddmpc)　＋ higher level controller design(whl3_platoon)
# Note: the original file come from the first work, whl1-LDMPC;
